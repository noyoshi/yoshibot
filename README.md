# yoshibot
## A super useful(?) irc bot written in Node.js

- Please do not use this bot. It is my first Node project and it will probably rek things.

## Features 
`^y [COMMAND]`
- I am thinking that I could add scripts to a repo, that yoshi bot could run in irc.
- I would have to approve the scripts (to prevent foobaring my hosting computer) but yeah it could be cool!
- Maybe I could add a feature where users could have mini enviornments where they can run commands via yoshi bot? They could save files and read/write files? It would need to be containerized so that they wont `rm -rf /` me.
